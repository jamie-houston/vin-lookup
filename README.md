# Vin Lookup

This is a site I quickly put together to find out what Kia Telluride's were being produced and what dealers they are going to.

This is being hosted on [Heroku](http://telluride-lookup.herokuapp.com/).

For more info on Tellurides, I recommend [this forum](https://tellurideforum.org/)
